### Grade School

### \    

### Dean Petrich was born September 15, 1950 in Seattle.  He started piano lessons in kindergarten.  Every week for the next six years Dean and his sister Dawn took swimming lessons from the beginning to the advanced classes. In first grade Dean was one of the best readers in the class. His second grade teacher was a square dance instructor, so by the age of seven Dean knew a large repertoire of square dances.  In third grade he won a crossword-puzzle-making contest, and began cutting out articles from the newspapers on pollution and transportation issues. Dean's father built him a large treehouse around seven trees, where Dean stored his collection of Mad magazines. By fourth grade Dean was in cub scouts, began playing the violin, taught himself how to type, and wrote, directed and starred in his first play.  Starting from a library book, he performed his first of many magic shows; for Christmas that year Dean opened his first magic kit.  In the '40's and '50's there was an amusement park by Bitter Lake in north Seattle called "Playland;" Dean's favorite place to go was the Fun House, complete with funny mirrors, moving floors, rotating barrels, and slides. By fifth grade he was first violin in the orchestra and had learned to play the violin on his head, behind his back, under his leg and in his mouth; he sang soprano in the choir; wrote and produced another play; had developed a keen interest in studying the weather and had developed the knack of correctly predicting it; and was performing magic professionally.  By sixth grade Dean could type 80 words/minute on an old-style typewriter; he wrote yet another play, did more magic, continued with both piano and violin, completed all his cub scout achievements, and began downhill snow skiing. He also was a loyal member of the traffic safety patrol, was a dishwasher in the lunch room, and ran for student body president.  From the age of eight to sixteen he spent his summers at Hendersons' Camps, where he learned archery, riflery, horseback riding, swimming, woodworking, campcrafts, folkdancing, sailing, canoing, kayaking, theatrics, story-telling, baking, Indian lore, pottery, and the skills of comradship.  During the summer between sixth and seventh grade Dean worked at a musical summer camp. His job was to tune 80 violins during each recess, to assist the school director with set-up; occassionally he was allowed to conduct the orchestra.  At the end of the camp he performed in front of everyone by playing comedy violin.

In seventh grade he produced a prolific amount of line mazes, performed magic before the entire student body, took up judo, oil painting and clay sculpting.  He played violin in the Seattle Youth Symphony, held several offices in DeMolay, and was President of the Junior Magicians' Club of Seattle.  From 1958-1968 he frequented the Washington Athletic Club weekly where he took judo and swimming.  During these years at Lakeside Dean immersed himself in art, drama, music and publications.  He was a photographer and writer for the school newspaper, year book, and literary magazine. The sports he most excelled at were fencing (state champion team),  diving and swimming on the swim team, and he lettered in both cross-country and track (the mile: 4:49).  He was a junior ski patrol during the weekends at the Mountaineers Snoqualmie Lodge.  At fifteen he took the Mountaineers Basic Climbing Course and climbed several peaks, including Mount Baker.  He made two movies, acted in every play and musical, sang in the choir, and formed his own barbershop quartet.  His sixteenth summer was spent at a horse and mountaineering camp in Colorado where he climbed three peaks in one day, rafted down the Colorado River and was the champion of the obstacle course.  During his seventeenth summer he
