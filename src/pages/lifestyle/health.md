         How can we live lightly in a heavily populated and polluted environment? The answer is to make many small changes in the way we currently live. We can start with simple things, like changing our lightbulbs to LEDs, by recycling, by driving less and bicycling more, by growing some food in whatever small or large space that we have, whether it be pea vines up a wall and herbs in a windowbow, or turning a vacant lot into an organic farm. We can converrt the products in our homes to products made with safe, non-toxic and environmentally sensitive ingredients. As we can afford it, we can add solar panels for hot water and electricity, catch rainwater and filter it, possibly install composting toilets and grey water treatment systems, and maybe even figure out a way to make money from home so as to reduce the need to travel.

         By reducing travel time and increasing home time we enable ourselves to save money, to devote more attention to improving the education of ourselves and our families, and to diversify our forms of recreation and entertainment. In an urban setting we can create vertical farms, arcologies, people spaces and explosive culture while converting our inefficient transportation habits to a large number of significantly more efficient system options.

         In these pages you can read about what you can do to make your home, and those of your friends, a green home. You can rethink how you want to travel, how you could be making money, what form of education is relevant, and what types of recreation and entertainment are constructive.
