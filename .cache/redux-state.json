The new descriptions are more detailed and hence allow cuppers to distinguish between more flavors.\n\nWhile this is going to be a big change for professional coffee tasters, it means a lot to you as a consumer as well. We’ll explain how the wheel came to be, how pros use it and what the flavors actually mean.\n\n## What the updates mean to you\n\nThe Specialty Coffee Association of America (SCAA), founded in 1982, is a non-profit trade organization for the specialty coffee industry. With members located in more than 40 countries, SCAA represents every segment of the specialty coffee industry, including:\n\n* producers\n* roasters\n* importers/exporters\n* retailers\n* manufacturers\n* baristas\n\nFor over 30 years, SCAA has been dedicated to creating a vibrant specialty coffee community by recognizing, developing and promoting specialty coffee. SCAA sets and maintains quality standards for the industry, conducts market research, and provides education, training, resources, and business services for its members.\n\nCoffee cupping, or coffee tasting, is the practice of observing the tastes and aromas of brewed coffee. It is a professional practice but can be done informally by anyone or by professionals known as \"Q Graders\". A standard coffee cupping procedure involves deeply sniffing the coffee, then loudly slurping the coffee so it spreads to the back of the tongue.\n\nThe coffee taster attempts to measure aspects of the coffee's taste, specifically the body (the texture or mouthfeel, such as oiliness), sweetness, acidity (a sharp and tangy feeling, like when biting into an orange), flavour (the characters in the cup), and aftertaste. Since coffee beans embody telltale flavours from the region where they were grown, cuppers may attempt to identify the coffee's origin.\n",

The Chemex Coffeemaker is a manual, pour-over style glass-container coffeemaker that Peter Schlumbohm invented in 1941, and which continues to be manufactured by the Chemex Corporation in Chicopee, Massachusetts.\n\nIn 1958, designers at the [Illinois Institute of Technology](https://www.spacefarm.digital) said that the Chemex Coffeemaker is _\"one of the best-designed products of modern times\"_, and so is included in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.\n\n## The little secrets of Chemex brewing\n\nThe Chemex Coffeemaker consists of an hourglass-shaped glass flask with a conical funnel-like neck (rather than the cylindrical neck of an Erlenmeyer flask) and uses proprietary filters, made of bonded paper (thicker-gauge paper than the standard paper filters for a drip-method coffeemaker) that removes most of the coffee oils, brewing coffee with a taste that is different than coffee brewed in other coffee-making systems; also, the thicker paper of the Chemex coffee filters may assist in removing cafestol, a cholesterol-containing compound found in coffee oils. Here’s three important tips newbies forget about:\n\n1. Always buy dedicated Chemex filters.\n2. Use a scale, don’t try to eyeball it.\n3. Never skip preheating the glass.\n4. Timing is key, don’t forget the clock.\n\nThe most visually distinctive feature of the Chemex is the heatproof wooden collar around the neck, allowing it to be handled and poured when full of hot water. This is turned, then split in two to allow it to fit around the glass neck. The two pieces are held loosely in place by a tied leather thong. The pieces are not tied tightly and can still move slightly, retained by the shape of the conical glass.\n\nFor a design piece that became popular post-war at a time of Modernism and precision manufacture, this juxtaposition of natural wood and the organic nature of a hand-tied knot with the laboratory nature of glassware was a distinctive feature of its appearance.\n",

We’ll be offering the roasted beans from Tuesday, but quantities are limited, so be quick.\n\nBlue Mountain Peak is the highest mountain in Jamaica and one of the highest peaks in the Caribbean at 7,402 ft. It is the home of Blue Mountain coffee and their famous tours. It is located on the border of the Portland and Saint Thomas parishes of Jamaica.\n\n## A little history\n\nThe Blue Mountains are considered by many to be a hiker's and camper's paradise. The traditional Blue Mountain trek is a 7-mile hike to the peak and consists of a 3,000-foot increase in elevation. Jamaicans prefer to reach the peak at sunrise, thus the 3–4 hour hike is usually undertaken in darkness. Since the sky is usually very clear in the mornings, Cuba can be seen in the distance.\n\n>Some of the plants found on the Blue Mountain cannot be found anywhere else in the world and they are often of a dwarfed sort.\n\nThis is mainly due to the cold climate which inhibits growth. The small coffee farming communities of Claverty Cottage and Hagley Gap are located near the peak.\n\n## What you need to know before trying\n\nJamaican Blue Mountain Coffee or Jamaica Blue Mountain Coffee is a classification of coffee grown in the Blue Mountains of Jamaica. The best lots of Blue Mountain coffee are noted for their mild flavor and lack of bitterness. Over the past few decades, this coffee has developed a reputation that has made it one of the most expensive and sought-after coffees in the world. Over 80% of all Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee is exported to Japan. In addition to its use for brewed coffee, the beans are the flavor base of Tia Maria coffee liqueur.\n\nJamaican Blue Mountain Coffee is a globally protected certification mark, meaning only coffee certified by the Coffee Industry Board of Jamaica can be labeled as such. It comes from a recognized growing region in the Blue Mountain region of Jamaica, and its cultivation is monitored by the Coffee Industry Board of Jamaica.\n\nThe Blue Mountains are generally located between Kingston to the south and Port Antonio to the north. Rising 7,402 ft, they are some of the highest mountains in the Caribbean. The climate of the region is cool and misty with high rainfall. The soil is rich, with excellent drainage. This combination of climate and soil is considered ideal for coffee.\n",

He started piano lessons in kindergarten.  Every week for the next six years Dean and his sister Dawn took swimming lessons from the beginning to the advanced classes. In first grade Dean was one of the best readers in the class. His second grade teacher was a square dance instructor, so by the age of seven Dean knew a large repertoire of square dances.  In third grade he won a crossword-puzzle-making contest, and began cutting out articles from the newspapers on pollution and transportation issues. Dean's father built him a large treehouse around seven trees, where Dean stored his collection of Mad magazines. By fourth grade Dean was in cub scouts, began playing the violin, taught himself how to type, and wrote, directed and starred in his first play.  Starting from a library book, he performed his first of many magic shows; for Christmas that year Dean opened his first magic kit.  In the '40's and '50's there was an amusement park by Bitter Lake in north Seattle called \"Playland;\" Dean's favorite place to go was the Fun House, complete with funny mirrors, moving floors, rotating barrels, and slides. By fifth grade he was first violin in the orchestra and had learned to play the violin on his head, behind his back, under his leg and in his mouth; he sang soprano in the choir; wrote and produced another play; had developed a keen interest in studying the weather and had developed the knack of correctly predicting it; and was performing magic professionally.  By sixth grade Dean could type 80 words/minute on an old-style typewriter; he wrote yet another play, did more magic, continued with both piano and violin, completed all his cub scout achievements, and began downhill snow skiing. He also was a loyal member of the traffic safety patrol, was a dishwasher in the lunch room, and ran for student body president.  From the age of eight to sixteen he spent his summers at Hendersons' Camps, where he learned archery, riflery, horseback riding, swimming, woodworking, campcrafts, folkdancing, sailing, canoing, kayaking, theatrics, story-telling, baking, Indian lore, pottery, and the skills of comradship.  During the summer between sixth and seventh grade Dean worked at a musical summer camp. His job was to tune 80 violins during each recess, to assist the school director with set-up; occassionally he was allowed to conduct the orchestra.  At the end of the camp he performed in front of everyone by playing comedy violin. \n\n### .\n\n### High School \n\n### \n\n### \\    From seventh to twelth grade he attended Lakeside School.   In seventh grade he produced a prolific amount of line mazes, performed magic before the entire student body, took up judo, oil painting and clay sculpting.  He played violin in the Seattle Youth Symphony, held several offices in DeMolay, and was President of the Junior Magicians' Club of Seattle.  From 1958-1968 he frequented the Washington Athletic Club weekly where he took judo and swimming.  During these years at Lakeside Dean immersed himself in art, drama, music and publications.  He was a photographer and writer for the school newspaper, year book, and literary magazine. The sports he most excelled at were fencing (state champion team),  diving and swimming on the swim team, and he lettered in both cross-country and track (the mile: 4:49).  He was a junior ski patrol during the weekends at the Mountaineers Snoqualmie Lodge.  At fifteen he took the Mountaineers Basic Climbing Course and climbed several peaks, including Mount Baker.  He made two movies, acted in every play and musical, sang in the choir, and formed his own barbershop quartet.  His sixteenth summer was spent at a horse and mountaineering camp in Colorado where he climbed three peaks in one day, rafted down the Colorado River and was the champion of the obstacle course.  During his seventeenth summer he\n",
